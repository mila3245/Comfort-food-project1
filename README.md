Presentation Template 

Your presentations are a reflection of the work that you have done as a team. We should have a clear understanding of what the application does, why it was built, and how it was built before we ever experienced your application demo.

Your presentation should translate easily to your informative README. 

Presentation 
1.	Description of what it does w/ Visual Support: Gif / Image of your app doing it.
2.	Motivation for building this w/ Research you did: Into existing apps how is this different how is this the same?
3.	How did you build it out? w/ Infographic of your work-flow
4.	User Stories => Features => task => Branches => Git Commits
5.	User Stories w/ Gif of your application UI completing that user story
6.	Planning Wireframe w/ Side by Side of initial Wireframe vs. end product
7.	Task Assignment => Who did what?
8.	Team work-flow => Working Agreements Stand-ups Playbacks
9.	API Research….

Teamwork & Expectations

Team Effort
Before anything, remember that Projects are a group effort: Working closely with your teammates is a requirement. This both helps teach real-world collaborative workflows, and enables you to tackle more difficult problems than you'd be able to working alone.
In other words, working in groups allows you to work smart and dream big. Take advantage of it!
Note: 
●	100% participation and attendance is required in order to receive credit for the Group Project work. 
●	Participation in all 3 Projects are course requirements.  

How will you be using Git?

Git Commit #


Stuck time ( How long until you consult a teammate?):
●	30 min? 
●	1 hour? 


Working Agreements:

EXAMPLE: 

During Sprint Do The Following:

●	Team members attend daily stand ups @ 6:30pm (T,TH) 10am (sat)
●	We will be expected to be working on Sun and M,W,F (is this true?)
●	Should a team member have a conflict, s/he/they updates the slack team channel in advance of the meeting
●	We believe in in the value of planning collectively as a team
●	Every Team Member is engaged and involved.
●	Every Team Member is committed to the value of the application over individual recognition.
●	Every Team Member will practice active listening.
●	Every Team Member will be directly engaged with the work - not answer texts or phone calls, social media, or other off-topic material (with the exception of emergencies -which will be communicated to the team)


Your Team Working Agreements
During Sprint Do The Following:





Agile Stand-Ups:
For software teams, the stand-up is like the team’s huddle. It’s even commonly known as the daily scrum, and reinforces “we” to keep everyone aware of the team’s landscape and progress.

A stand-up is a daily meeting that involves the core team. 
This meeting’s flavor is unique to each team, but commonly we use three simple questions to generate structure: 
1.	What did I work on yesterday? 
2.	What am I working on today? 
3.	What issues are blocking me? 

These questions highlight progress and help flag team blockers. Also, it strengthens the team when everyone shares the progress they’re contributing to the team. The daily reinforcement of sharing individual successes and plans keeps everyone excited about the team’s overall progress. 

Agile Playbacks:
Teams sometimes have a weekly/bi-weekly meeting called a "playback". This meeting allows team members to explain and demo completed features and the work they did during this past sprint. (normally a work week). Playbacks are important to keep project managers up to date, as well other team members to what has been accomplished during a sprint.
The playback format:
○	Tell your team what you worked on and how it went.
○	Show the progress you have made on your work.
○	Demo any finished work/features.
We encourage you to set up time for playbacks at the end of each sprint.

Project Title: 	The Comfort Food Concept 

 Logo Image: Comfort food
 
Project Description
Before you start writing any code, your group should outline the scope and purpose of your project. This helps provide direction and prevent scope creep.

Write this as a summary of your interests and intent, including:
●	Problem / Motivation
●	How it addresses the problem
●	Possible source for such data
Summary
Dark kitchen and food deliveries have seen massive growth since 2020 because of the Covid19 pandemic. We have designed Comfort Food App to contribute to existing ways different people such as busy professionals and weight-conscious individuals can work out a good meal at lunchtime yet carry on with their daily tasks. The goal of Comfort Food is to unite and simplify the three steps of preparing delicious home-cooked meals: plan, shop and cook, into one intuitive process. In the meantime, it provides an atmosphere to encourage, inspire and elevate the next-gen home cooks.

Problem to solve. 
•	People prefer to pick fresh produce from brick-and-mortar stores to ensure their quality.
•	Due to the large quantity and variety of items, online grocery shopping can be repetitive and tedious compared to other online shopping experiences.
•	Meal plan services help reduce waste and save shopping time but have limited options and are less affordable.
•	High delivery cost is a major barrier to shopping groceries online.
•	Home cooking is cost-effective and is more appealing to health-conscious people. The challenge is that it is time-consuming, and people need better incentives than hunger to step into the kitchen.

Our initial assumptions 
The following assumptions on how the app could potentially help with the problems observed or experienced in home cooking and grocery shopping are:
•	Most people read ratings and reviews before making a purchase decision.
-Incentives are needed to encourage people to give feedback.
•	Online shoppers like the option of free shipping above a certain cost.
-If people plan out the number of groceries needed for the next several meals, they can save on delivery and reduce food waste at the same time.

Research: 
According to the research Evaluating Online Grocery Shopping Habits by International Food Information Council, Feb 2018:
•	The biggest barriers to online grocery shopping are the cost of items/delivery, and the time it takes for groceries to be delivered.
•	The top purchased grocery items are Snacks, cereals, and canned goods. While the least purchased items are Meat, seafood, dairy, eggs, and pre-made meals, indicating that the quality of perishable products is also a concern of online shoppers.
User preferences
•	It is faster than self-service in-store.
•	It is easy to navigate the products categorized by type.
•	Product information is easily identified in a set format.
•	After getting used to the system, shopping online is much faster.
What users do not like
•	The built-in search function is difficult to use without a spelling check.
•	The search bar only shows results for specific keywords, not similar or alternative suggestions.
•	The process of adding an item to the trolley is hard to follow for beginners.
•	Purchasing ingredients from different stores in one order is difficult.
•	Pricing strategy: Free download to attract users. Upgrade to unlock more features for power users. But how to determine the free and paid features is a challenge to fulfil various user needs.
•	The process of selecting alternatives within the same store.
•	How to encourage purchase when the minimum expense for free shipping is not met.
•	Helping customers in determining the number of goods.
•	Delivery services vary between stores. How to help users quickly determine which store to use when shopping.

Assumptions validated from the initial research.

Our assumptions were validated because each of the points on user preferences listed above represents a potential group targeting the audience with different pain points. These include motivations and preferences in trying to save travelling and shopping time.
Goals
•	Get inspiration for cooking.
•	Know the number of servings from a recipe.
•	Get cooking tips.
•	Buy quality food ingredients.
•	Find nutrition information on the product.
•	Have a shopping list to use in-store.
Motivation
•	Find recipes for specific ingredients.
•	Find recipes for a certain type of dishes.
•	A good place to post and share recipes.
•	Have a place to keep all the shopping lists.
•	Buy quality groceries online from trusted stores.
•	Reduce waste by cutting the temptation of buying extra.

Project Reflection

Retrospective Notes: 
Team Reflection: 

●	What Went Well
●	What Did not go well
●	What can WE improve for next time


Issues 	What went well 	What did not go well 	What we did 	What can WE improve for next time

Leadership	We adopted situational leadership		We all led at different times during the project depending on the problem we are facing as we all have diverse experiences, so we utilised it	
Work-sharing 	Explored our different areas of strength		So we all chose different parts where we understood more to start with	
Team working tools	We utilised all available collaborative software we know 		Microsoft teams (meeting), Trello, figma, the scrum approach, GitHub, Slack	
Problems everyone encountered was shared		Committing to Github	Due to branch formation- we deleted folder after day 2 and started all over	Tiffany gave us a recorded video.
-We found use of desktop GitHub most effective
Technical Knowledge sharing 			More communication and use of tutorials, video clips
